### Only Eyes For Me
I am floating.<br />
The water soaks the flowers.<br />
I am floating<br />
in a boat under the rain.<br />
In the rain I sleep with<br />
the fishes under moonlight.<br />
I am floating.<br />

The moonlight that<br />
shines its graces on<br />
you, my queen.<br />

In distant past<br />
when this land was for only us,<br />
in distant past<br />
men took you away from me.<br />
And left you to rot with all the<br />
fishes under the moonlight.<br />
In distant past.

Yet no missiles can<br />
take you away from me.<br />
My daisy queen.

Because we are not merely of the flesh.<br />
There is more to us than meets the eyes my queen,<br />
the zombie queen whom only has eye for me.
