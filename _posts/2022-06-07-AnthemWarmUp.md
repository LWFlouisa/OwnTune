## My Sister's Apple
An apple red.<br />
It is this I hand my sister.<br />
An apple red.<br />
She savors its juices swiftly.<br />
The apple red with its taste<br />
puckers her lips, purple tung.<br />
An apple red.

For my soeur she<br />
likes it sweet, sour,<br />
and full of the sap.

Girl in red dress.<br />
With red tap dancing dresses.<br />
Girl in red dress.<br />
Wearing rain clogs in the thunder.<br />
With her umbreya soaking.<br />
The bits of water in the storm.<br />
Girl in red dress.

For my soeur, my<br />
mentor, her smile mine.<br />
Yet life drifts away.
