## My Sister's Apple
An apple red.<br />
It is this I hand my sister.<br />
An apple red.<br />
She savors its juices swiftly.<br />
The apple red with its taste<br />
puckers her lips, purple tung.<br />
An apple red.

For my soeur she<br />
likes it sweet, sour,<br />
and full of the sap.

Girl in red dress.<br />
With red tap dancing dresses.<br />
Girl in red dress.<br />
Wearing rain clogs in the thunder.<br />
With her umbreya soaking.<br />
The bits of water in the storm.<br />
Girl in red dress.

For my soeur, my<br />
mentor, her smile mine.<br />
Yet life drifts away.

# Next Song
The next song will be a continuation of this band style.

## A Bond Stronger Than Guns And Canons
At ease Comrades.<br />
The day of rest has arrived.<br />
For we are chosen to inherit<br />
the fruits of our ancestors past.<br />
Will you join in our last stand,<br />
And make our freedoms last?<br />

May our reign last for one thousand,<br />
eight thousand years.<br />
Until the last speck of dust,<br />
withers into the sands of time.<br />

Refrain<br />
We are the bakers with baguettes,<br />
and the farmers who grow cherry trees.<br />
From the fields of glory to the distant pastures.<br />
Let our freedoms last for many generations.<br />

We were once slaves to distant lands from East to West,<br />
With languages not our own.<br />
Yet here we our survivors after the fall of Rome,<br />
We don't need kings or masters,<br />
because we our the masters of our own dominion.<br />

Refrain<br />
We are the bakers with baguettes,<br />
and the farmers who grow cherry trees.<br />
From the fields of glory to the distant pastures.<br />
Let our freedoms last for many generations.<br />

Those in other land may have guns and canons,<br />
yet we have something much stronger that is a lasting bond,<br />
Based on common values that blends<br />
our parents from distant lands.<br />

Though we our from Europe and from Asia,<br />
We need be limited to this, for we are "Cool Japan",<br />
Not Cruel France, with their imperial enablers in the East.
