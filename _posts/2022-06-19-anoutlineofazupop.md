This is an outline for my plans as a writer of novels, short stories, and poetry. And how I plan to go forward in my music career, as somewhere between J-Pop and K-Pop. K-Pop has the advantage of nurturing a closer relationship with fans, while J-Pop has the advantage of allowing the audience to grow with its musicians.

At present I’m not quite ready to get into piano playing full time as I’m very out of practice, but working on fleshing out my abilities while working on other things like finishing up my graphic novel Uploaded Fairy.

I already have some chords based on current musical scales, and one I invented that acts as a flattered version of Yo scale. I also use Mixolydian mode, which is commonly featured in French music. With the aim of eventually combining the musical traditions of Japan and France.

I’m influenced by Nobue Uematsu and Elsa Lughini, if and when I ever develop a singing voice. The cross-over has led to some issues about possibly being into Korean music, which do not misunderstand is quite good...at times. But not in K-Pop.

So here I will go into my specific:

## IDEALS
-- I value authenticity and historical accuracy.<br />
-- I want the freedom to be able to grow over time.<br />
-- I value the ability to adapt to new situations.<br />

## EXPECTATIONS
-- I expect a degree of gallows humor and self-deprecation.<br />
-- About the removal of attachment from the material.<br />
-- The creator should be able to experiment as they need to to perfect their craft.<br />
-- A do yourself aesthetic that allows for a degree of Japanese style minimalism in design.<br />

## ANARCHISM
-- If the band arrangement must be sustained through aggression, then it must be discarded.<br />
-- Desires total freedom of the individual creator.

## INSTRUMENTATION
While there is a general pattern in instruments used, the creator is also encouraged to learn as many instruments as possible, so one can adapt to the context by switching instruments. [ A keyboard to an accordion. ]

-- Flute<br />
-- Harmonica<br />
-- Tap Dancing

It thus values situations of the unplanned.

## LANGUAGE
I am to continue fleshing out the Os Azusacos Language, which is a kind of French and Japanese hybrid that using Japanese vocabulary, and French grammar to create a thing that resembles something of its own rhythm pattern.

## IDEAS OF PERFECTION
I seek a kind of Wabi Sabi like feeling in outfits that embraces aspects of the imperfect aspect of nature. This can allow for people to wear more comfortable clothes during the concept.
