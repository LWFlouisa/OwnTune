After looking more into K-Pop, I have many more questions than answers. For example, aside from what bands there are, what the standards of censorship compared to J-Pop. For those who don’t know, I’m a fan of Jin Oki, but recently found some Korean Flamenco guitarists. So if something like Flamenco is available in Korea, what exactly isn’t?

However the Korean wave has had some interesting effects on social media. For example, it doesn’t seem to matter if I’m uploading full character illustrations, character portraits, or full comic pages, it always seems to evolve into K-Pop. I’ve tried experimenting with evolving Alsatian ( French speaking region of Germany ) and Japanese fashion together. But it always seems to evolve into: Korean fashion.

On further research, apparently French fashion is considerably influenced by Korean fashion, so in effect combining French and Japanese fashion ends up becoming like blending Korean and Japanese fashion. Which already happens, for as far as I can tell, there seems to be a sizable Korean fashion industry in Japan.

Even when I deliberately go out of my way to handpick specific clothes for my MCs for my web comic: it seems like even then I get recommended Korean fashion on Pinterest. So I’m starting to wonder at times if I’ve chased after the wrong thing as a web comic creator, as back when I read manga, I would also read Manhwa.

So as I grew up drawing my graphic novel ( after writing nine novels ) I had always been a fusion of manga and manhwa, and to me explains the mixed reception I would get for Uploaded Fairy. But this creates a whole other set of issues.

When I was on Pinterest, apparently people figured out ( even though I don’t really talk about it on my socials ) I have...an interest...in a certain kind of foot ware. It’s obvious what I mean when you look at how I style my clothing choices. A certain fandom, I wont name who, then used that as the opportunity to misgender me by saying I’m “a flip flop kind of guy”.

To be technical, those aren’t thongs, and that be $145 bucks for a pair. And yet weirdly they didn’t seem to mind being influenced by the fashion choices. So which is it? So it’s starting to make me curious if a lot of what makes K-Pop what it is, if they’re better at finding out who their customers are than J-Pop seems to be.

And that might be a large part of K-Pop’s success.
