We the undersigned, are tired of the elitism present in the punk rock and hard scifi communities. What started out as a means of beating the system, turned into a cash grab by corporate record labels, co-opting our language and customs.

There are also several differences between us, and the rest of the cyberpunk community. No longer is sought the comfort of cyberspace, and finding relationships on the net. Gone is the focus on advanced computer technology. Big Tech using our language and customs for marketing purposes.

Instead, we seek a return to more traditional means of exploring theoretical ideas and concepts, especially revolving around reincarnation. With only a slight hint of technology in subtle aspects like underground catacombs.

Instead, we prefer a focus on human relationships, and especially of the tragic sort within the scope of the written word: weâ€™re not the cheerleader with pom poms that always get the guy she wants. Or the nerd that becomes a prince in shining armor at the end of a soup opera.

We seek the total elimination of bounds within mortality, exploring relationships that exist beyond the realm of any given lifetime. Even if any one particular life ends in a tragic minor, do to the nature of the time a character lives. No longer should the focus on making accurate predictions in AI.

Instead we explore the psychology of societies outcasts within the realm of the paranormal experience, living on the edge between Real Life Vampire clans.

We are the readers and writers of Belle Mort.
