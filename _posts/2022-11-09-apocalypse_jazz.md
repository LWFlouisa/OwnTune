I think I decided to focus my efforts on developing a personal sub-genre within jazz music; this wouldnâ€™t be exactly like Gypsy Jazz, as there would be a few differences from that. Rather it would be more of an operatic kind of jazz that focuses on a grander storyline within an alternate history context.

At present the current alternate history in set in a time period when the original Franco-Japanese war never completely ended, but rather simply gone into stalemate. The old rivalry between the French and Japanese empire carried over into after the collapse of the United States as a world power, and old feud began to resurface into the 21st century in North America.

I finally managed to figure out what the musical scale would most sound like, which blends aspects of Pentatonic Minor ( three of the scales that belong to it ), and variations of Mixolydian and Spanish Gypsy scales. One of my viewers seems to have interrupted my music, however, as a kind of jazz. Which would be...I guess kind of true...except it would be a blend of French and Japanese jazz rather than US based.

All this to mean is I may be rethinking how to build my personal brand identity that fit more into a kind of jazz for a specific kind of post apocalyptic context. Generally one where the main super powers are France and Japan, rather than ( in our timeline ) even South Korea.

As an interesting note however, one of the Kyemyonjo scales actually covers the notes that are often found within one of the scales of Pentatonic Minor.
