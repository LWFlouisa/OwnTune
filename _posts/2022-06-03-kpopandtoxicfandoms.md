This essay will be about why I wont be contributing to the KPop boom. I’ve known people online that apparently share the same interest in Asian women, except that I generally have a preference for Japanese girls and J-Culture. On the other hand, they seem to have a preference for Korean culture. The main underlying issue is the only reason they’re interested in Korea is because it’s presently trendy at the moment. Once KPop stops becoming a cultural phenomenon, eventually they’ll move onto other things.

With a lot of political groups online, a lot of them tend to be this way in general. But this is in additional to the fact that sometimes K-Pop will make overtures to try to reach other to fans. And yet curious never seem to be aware of toxic fandoms within their own communities. And yet, this is supposedly what’s suppose to win me over from K-Pop.

I have a very specific vision for what I want to do, and it has nothing to do with the fear of a Japanese future. But more specifically, my interest has been in seeing what a future that combines Japanese and French culture would be like. Such interests don’t really change based on what’s currently trending in the pop cultural scene

More specifically, the trendiness fact is generally a relatively poor reason to be into different cultures, which indicates an issue where they’re not really into actually exploring different cultures. So on twitter I’m being dragged down by people whom don’t even share the same goals. And it certainly does not sell me on K-Pop, especially in light of toxic fans within K-Pop.

If K-Pop wants to be sold to people whom prefer J-Pop, it needs to work on the toxicity within its own community, rather than bother people who like create fashion styles, mostly for themselves, and sometimes maybe for one K-Pop idol they might like. I’m not going to be switching to K-Pop any time soon, if fandoms continue to be the problem they are, and I can’t really take what’s actually truth or disinformation.
