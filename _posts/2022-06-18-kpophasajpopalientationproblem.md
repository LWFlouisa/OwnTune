Bridging alliances has to go both ways, whether that’s government policy or pop music. It doesn’t matter if that’s J-Pop or K-Pop. However twitter in particular has a problem with people coming into fandoms, specifically for the purpose of starting shit. There is especially pervasive in K-Pop, where old fans of J-Pop feel increasingly isolated from the rest of the world.

The other issue is that sign language symbols of the same shape, can mean vastly different things, based on what country your in. For example, the thumbs up in certain countries besides the US. They train these people to be multi-lingual, supposedly. And yet all people can come up with is using vague symbols of I love you or I hate you.

From a historical perspective, similar types of issues arose with Webtoon as well, where one of the editors said that drawing comics was a fun little side hobby. While artists who actually did comics were barely making any money. Eventually this inevitably caused a backlash, and these days Webtoon is almost nearly as toxic as Youtube can be. It’s the Youtube of comics.

And where does this bring me to K-Pop? There is a band in particular that has one of the worst issues of people trying to lure people into joining website for paying for votes. Eventually information like that is going to get out there. Imagine trying to convince someone who grew up on J-Pop, that only K-Pop was a fun little side hobby. And certainly not worth listening to.

I honestly believe that K-Pop is going to be its own kind of bubble like J-Pop. It may happen five years from now, it may happen ten years from now. But your not going to win any allies who grew up with J-Pop, by alienating us from our own market. There are people that also try to convince you it’s not worth both listening to K-Pop and J-Pop.

It seems like South Korea in particular is especially prone to these kinds of lapses of judgment that end up alienating their fans. And that doesn’t include the amount of debt K-Pop idols get in before they make money. I feel like one Rock band in K-Pop is essentially like the Alita Army of K-Pop, and they only get away with it by being cute.

It could at least be clarified what some symbols mean in Korean, and what they don't mean. Like sideways F being laughing.
