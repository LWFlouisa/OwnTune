### INTRO
It’s tempting to take people at their world online, when it comes to information about learning foreign languages, such as learning French or Japanese as I’ve been trying to do the last few months. But this can lead to issues: take for example K-Pop. It may not actually be the best way to learn about Korean culture. Japan is a little different in that it doesn’t have the same social issues pervasive in K-Pop.

When I was trying to learn even French, most of what I had to contend with was being constantly corrected about my French. Japan doesn’t even have that many issues, just the writing system is somewhat of a hurdle. With learning Korean, there is the added fact that most people’s access to Korean culture is by route of K-Pop, filled with people whom, if your a ballad musician, may not like the same kind of music. Among other fandom issues, like toxic communities.

The main reason I mention this is I’ve known of people on YT that advocate for using Pop music to learn a language. But the thing with Korean, and Japanese is becoming more that way: it will sometimes slip between the mother language and English. Which is not unhelpful in its own right for a language learner, but this is on top of communities whose may focus isn’t language learning.

And yet often people that create their own language, will be the ones that get bashed by anyone on the internet, from a random leftist to a Neo-Nazi. Creating your own language is seen as a nerd pass time, and not for sophisticated chads and ladies who like K-Pop. Or J-Pop for that matter.

And yet the only way I’ve been able to really learning a language is by knowing how that language works, without distraction from other issues that don’t contribute to a learning environment.

### PROPOSAL
We need to focus on building language learning communities, and develop entertainment genres within that. For example, if your specialty is learning Esperanto ( it’s “Os Azusaco” here ) then you would build a cooking, music, and art communities focused around these circles. So the entire point is to learn in a safe and nurturing environment.

There are also political issues going on that make it untenable to try learning some languages like English. Without going into specifics, that political faction is making harder rather than easier to learn English, and I struggle to think what result this will have on people’s GPAs.

From there we can develop our own webcomic and pop culture communities independent of celebrity hot spots like YG Entertainment and Weekly Shounen Jump. We can build an entire industry from scratch if we wanted to. Although if spoken publicly you’ll be treated as separatist by people whom make it a career out of arguing in bad faith.

We need to develop out own language and dialect, that isn’t reliant on communities that constantly correct us about language, or tosses unnecessary fan wars at us, such as in K-Pop in particular. If K-Pop keeps pisses off everyone that could be a fan, there might not be a K-Pop going forward.


### HOW WE GET THERE
We can use conlanging resources, such as Language Creation Society. Although trust me in this, do not use their discord, it’s why I haven’t joined the discord of my favorite K-Pop community Dreamcatcher. Language creation doesn’t have to be all at once, and it certainly doesn’t have to operate like it does on twitter.

Although some good news, there is also conlangers who come from Korean and Japanese backgrounds. My goal as a designer to build a limited lingua Franca geared toward the Manga and Bande Dessine communities.

Although it remains to be seen whether this will also work for Indie Music culture as well. For example, there is a size able portfolio of music in Esperanto. The only reason smaller languages don’t have this, is because of lack of financial resources. But there are more of us into building fictional languages, then there are that see it as a waste of time.

My own goal remains to create web comics in my fictional language, rather than focus on how Japan, France, or Korea is inhospitable to language learners. But increasingly I’m starting to see the culture of my conlang differing, definitely from South Korea, but also Japan as well.

Some issue we may have to contend with: both Korea and Japan may not be so welcoming to constructed languages being taught. Japan do to wanting to preserve their culture, but K-Pop because despite the veneer of being welcome to outside talent, it’s every bit as closed off as Japan is.

But the goal is a language that anybody in France or French speaking territories, and Japanese and Japanese speaking territories and allies to use, in lack of a formal way of bridging the gap between Francophone and Japanese culture.

I could do that with English too, but I don’t see anywhere positive coming to US culture in the future.
