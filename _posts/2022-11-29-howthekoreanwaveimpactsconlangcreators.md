I started out having issues with French people, that went all the way back to my days as a Satanic Temple activist. The person I was living with at the time would twist my language in such a way, that she would make it looking like being opposed to the French guillotine was the same as being anti-French. Without going on a tangent, lets just say it took a long time for me to get to the point where I was even willing to consider learning French, especially in combination with the issues I already had with French-Americans, and to a lesser extent Spanish-Americans.

In general this has meant making an extra special effort to learning the French language, just to try and understand what the actual French mindset is on certain issues. For example, the French stance on imperialism and the death penalty, historically, the two main issues that had been the most important to me. Although as it turns out a considerable number of French people are actually against the death penalty.

In Japanese culture, specifically Cool Japan, they kind of bypassed those issues by being introduced to me by route of Tokyopop and the manga revolution. And so because in an abstract sense, I kind of grew up with a small slice of Japanese culture, it made it issue to transition into a support of Japanese culture more generally.

And for that reason I’ve wanted to pay an homage to both languages, as I slowly developed a fondness for either culture and language. And that also include some of their pop music. But this was all prior to the Korean Wave happening. To go into why that poses a problem, imagine if:

(1. You’re trying to overcome your issues with French culture.<br />
(2. You’re also trying to develop a constructed language that pays an homage to both cultures, while also critiquing both countries military histories.

Korean and the rest of East Asia other than China has had issues with both Japanese and French colonialism, which would mean in theory whatever issues they had with other culture would be vastly more understandable. But this poses a major problem if your developing a fictional language, where the entire reason it exists is to develop a common Lingua Franca that both French speakers and Japanese speakers can use without learning each other’s language.

And yet because of the way the Korean Wave, and K-Pop promotes itself, it makes I would eventually have to pitch a webcomic that not only uses a kind of “Francanese” constructed language, but also pitch a setting that’s in perpetual war between French and Japanese imperialism. I’ve always had issues anyway in creating this language, because there would always be that one guy that would try to strong arm how I build my own fictional language.

And the goal is a French and Japanese hybrid language, that operates as a naturalistic dialect that evolved into a separate ethnic language category. And so once again I’m having to hide what I’m doing, and to make it worse it’s from people whom you’d think would know better given their own history of being colonized by France and Japan from the 1860s to World War II.

Japan has had the benefit of me growing up with their language, and an appreciation for French culture came after I took personal effort to learn it, despite some serious barriers. Korea could avoid that crucial mistake France made that made even wanting to learn their language difficult.

Additionally, South Korea recently mandated the enlistment of BTS. Despite whatever contributions to national culture they made. The only reason this was on the news at all, was because of the fame of that particular K-Pop band. It’s also illegal to critique the system of Mandatory Enlistment as well, which is something even imperialist France didn’t have going on.

If K-Pop and Korean culture is interested in anyway to endear itself to me or anyone that grew up during Cool Japan, a good starting point might be trying to understand what my goals are as a fictional language creator and science fiction writer. Rather than specifically trying to have revenge on either Japan or France. They can also provide better resources for learning the Korean language as well. That don’t amount to people randomly correcting my Korean accent and grammar when I’m essentially understood.
