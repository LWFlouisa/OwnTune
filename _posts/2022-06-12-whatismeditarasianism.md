What is Asian-Aryanism, is why is it so dangerous, if taken to its natural conclusion? Asian-Aryanism’s point is to create an idealogy that unites the Anglosphere and Asiansphere against Black Nationalism. Implied in this, given where Aryanism originated, is a alliance between Fascist Germany and and Fascist Japan. Although I’m not sure if Asian-Aryans have caught up to this.

Meanwhile, I working on a graphic novel where the MC is a black haired trans girl, presumably Irish American, although the US at that point is controlled by France, although later it’s split between Japanese and French control. Her entire story arc is built around overcoming her issues learning languages, and how miscommunication lead to bigotry.

So where does Asian-Aryanism come in? In practice this ends up being the exact opposite of my goals, as someone who seeks to bridge the divide between Western Europe and East Asia, with a language that bridges the cultural divide, and is less likely to permit something like an Iron Heel or Man In The High Castle.

When I wrote the novel, it was written in light of the fact that it looked like Marine Le Pen might win the French election, and by that point it looked like, with Shinzo Abe’s Japan was becoming increasingly nationalistic. Therefore it was meant to depict a setting where France and Japan fought for control of the US.

Do you know what would happen if Marine Le Pen and Nationalist Japan were to ally together? Something far scarier than Asian-Aryanism, as French nationalism never completely went away, unlike German forms of fascism. It a sense it would be: Meditarasianism.
